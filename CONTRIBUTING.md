## FOR NEW CONTRIBUTORS

When submitting any new pull requests or issues, please make sure the contribution meets the following:
* For pull requests, please mention why you're pulling the files.  Since this is my personal portfolio, I'd like to know who's grabbing the files and why.
* For issues, please provide info as to what caused problems, what specific element of the page created those problems, and what type of device you were using when the issue occurred.

Thanks!

Josh
